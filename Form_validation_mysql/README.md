# Form_validation_mysql

In this assignment, the data submitted in the form is added to a MySQL database.

To test this, please make sure to have a DATABASE named "work" in your MySQL.

As the backend/env.php is added in the .gitignore file, please create your own.
Also please don't forget to add a backend/env.php file similar to this

`
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "YOUR USER NAME";
$password = "YOUR PASSWORD";
?>
`
